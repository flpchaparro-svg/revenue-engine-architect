## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### MEDIA — "I need them to listen."
- Summary: `Your team is on the road. They ignore written emails. You need training they can consume while driving.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: Audio training | Podcast-style updates | Mobile-first delivery | Bite-sized content

- **The Fleet Manager** (Logistics Companies, Removalists, Couriers) — Pain: The Unread Bulletin — `You send critical safety updates via email knowing 90% of your drivers never open them. Important information hits the bin, not the brain.` — Fix: `Audio bulletins they listen to in the truck. Same information, actually consumed.`
- **The Field Director** (Solar Installers, Multi-Site Teams) — Pain: Scattered Teams — `Your team is spread across 10 sites. Getting everyone in one room is impossible.` — Fix: `Training that travels with them. On their phone, in their ear, on their schedule.`
- **The Safety Officer** (Construction, Industrial) — Pain: Compliance Theatre — `You tick the box on training but nobody actually learns. It's paperwork, not education.` — Fix: `Engaging content they actually remember. Quizzes that prove they understood it.`

### MATRIX — "I need them to do it right."
- Summary: `Your team needs clear step-by-step processes. No confusion. No variation.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Screen recordings | SOPs | Process documentation | Knowledge base

- **The Process Owner** (Cafe Groups, Gyms, Retail) — Pain: Tribal Knowledge — `Only one person knows how to run the billing process. If they're sick, everything stops.` — Fix: `Documented SOPs with recordings. Anyone can follow the steps. No single point of failure.`
- **The Quality Controller** (Manufacturing, 3PLs) — Pain: Inconsistent Work — `Same task, 5 different approaches. Quality depends on who's working that day.` — Fix: `One documented method. Everyone follows the same steps. Consistent output.`
- **The Frustrated Manager** (Operations, Team Leads) — Pain: Repeated Mistakes — `You've explained the same process 50 times. They still get it wrong.` — Fix: `Video they can rewatch. Reference they can check. You explain once. They learn forever.`

### VISUALS — "I need to explain the complex."
- Summary: `Complex systems need clear explanations. Diagrams. Animations. Visual guides that make sense.`
- Sprint: `21 DAYS`
- Specs: Animated explainers | Interactive guides | Visual SOPs | System maps

- **The System Launcher** (IT, Change Management) — Pain: Rollout Resistance — `You're launching new software. Staff are already dreading it. They don't understand why things are changing.` — Fix: `Launch video that explains the "why." Visual walkthrough of the "how." Buy-in before day one.`
- **The Technical Trainer** (CRM, ERP Implementations) — Pain: Glazed Eyes — `You explain the CRM. Their eyes glaze over. A week later, they're asking the same questions.` — Fix: `Animated walkthrough they can pause and replay. Visual memory beats verbal explanation.`
- **The Integrator** (Multi-Tool Businesses) — Pain: System Confusion — `You have 5 tools. They connect somehow. Nobody knows how data flows between them.` — Fix: `System map that shows how everything connects. One visual. Total clarity.`
