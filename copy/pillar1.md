## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### STARTER — "I need a website that actually works."

- **The After-Hours Tradie** (Emergency plumbers, locksmiths, after-hours electricians) — Pain: The Missed Call — `You're under a sink at 11pm. Phone rings. You can't answer. That job goes to the next bloke on Google.` — Fix: `Instant SMS replies. When you miss a call, they get a text saying you'll call back within the hour. The job stays yours.`
- **The Quote Runner** (Pest control, solar installers, cleaners, pool guys) — Pain: The Wasted Quote — `You drive 45 minutes to quote a job. Turns out their budget is $200 for a $2,000 job. Half a day wasted on a tyre-kicker.` — Fix: `Forms that ask the right questions before they book. Budget, job size, timeline. You only quote jobs worth quoting.`
- **The Local Expert** (NDIS providers, physios, accountants, lawyers) — Pain: The Free Advice Trap — `You spend 10 hours a week on calls with people who can't afford you or don't actually need you.` — Fix: `Intake forms that filter out time-wasters before they reach your phone.`

- **The Boutique Owner** (Fashion boutiques, homewares, gift shops) — Pain: The Oversell — `Customer orders online. You check the shelf. Already sold in-store. Now you're apologising and refunding.` — Fix: `Your shop floor syncs to your website. Sell something in-store, the website updates instantly. No more double-selling.`
- **The Heavy Goods Seller** (Auto parts, building supplies, equipment, machinery) — Pain: The Shipping Problem — `Flat-rate shipping kills your margins on big items. You're either overcharging small orders or losing money on large ones.` — Fix: `Shipping that calculates based on weight, size, and postcode. Accurate quotes. Protected margins.`
- **The Subscription Box** (Coffee subscriptions, pet food, meal kits, supplements) — Pain: The Failed Payment — `Card expires. Payment fails. Customer churns.

Potential clients leave before they see it.` — Fix: `A site that loads your high-res photos instantly. Your work speaks. They stay.`
- **The Prestige Seller** (Yacht brokers, prestige cars, luxury real estate) — Pain: The Trust Killer — `You're asking clients to trust you with millions. Your WordPress site got hacked last month.

- **The Customiser** (Custom furniture, kitchens, lighting, bespoke interiors) — Pain: The Imagination Gap — `You sell custom furniture. Customers can't picture what they want. They hesitate. They leave.` — Fix: `A configurator where they pick the fabric, the legs, the size. They see it before they buy it.`
- **The Boutique Hotelier** (Boutique hotels, retreats, safari lodges, destination spas) — Pain: The Booking.com Tax — `OTAs take 15-20% of every booking.
