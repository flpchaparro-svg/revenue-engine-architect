## The Brief

- **INDUSTRY:** `Security Services`
- **SCOPE:** `Website Rebuild + Local SEO`
- **TIMELINE:** `4 Weeks`
- **The Brief** (heading): `The Brief`
- Body: `Group 7 Security protects some of Sydney's most valuable assets, including properties worth over $3.2 billion. But their website made them look like a 1990s template, not a professional security operation. Google didn't know they were in Sydney, and their competitors were taking all the local search traffic.`

## The Problem
- Eyebrow: `/ THE PROBLEM`

### Problem items (label, title, metric, desc, impact)

2. **Sydney Ranking** — `No Local Visibility` — `Near Zero` — `The .com domain had no location signals. Google thought they were an American company, not a Sydney business.` — Impact: `Invisible market.`
3. **Trust Score** — `Amateur Perception` — `Template` — `For a company protecting $3.2B in assets, the site looked like a weekend project. First impressions were killing them.` — Impact: `Failed due diligence.`
4. **Attribution** — `No Lead Capture` — `0%` — `Enquiries went to a generic inbox. No tracking, no automation. They had no idea which marketing was working.` — Impact: `Marketing blindness.`
