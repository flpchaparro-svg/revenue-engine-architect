- **INDUSTRY:** `Security Services`
- **SCOPE:** `Website Rebuild + Local SEO`
- **TIMELINE:** `4 Weeks`
- Section heading: `The Brief`
- Body: `Group 7 Security protects some of Sydney's most valuable assets. Properties worth over $3.2 billion. But their website made them look like a 1990s template, not a serious security operation. Google didn't know they were in Sydney. Their competitors were taking all the local traffic.`
