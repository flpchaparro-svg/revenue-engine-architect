## The Brief
- Bar: `CLIENT: GROUP 7 SECURITY`
- **INDUSTRY:** `Security Services`
- **SCOPE:** `Website Rebuild + Local SEO`
- **TIMELINE:** `4 Weeks`
- Body: `Group 7 Security protects some of Sydney's most valuable assets. Properties worth over $3.2 billion. But their website made them look like a 1990s template, not a serious security operation. Google didn't know they were in Sydney. Their competitors were taking all the local traffic.`

## The Problem
- Eyebrow: `/ THE PROBLEM`
- Headline: `The Old Site.` ("Site." red, italic)
- Badge: `group7security.com` — `DECOMMISSIONED`

### Problem items (full copy)
1. **Load Time** — Title: `Speed Was Killing Conversions` — Metric: `4.2 seconds` — Description: `Google says anything over 3 seconds loses half your mobile visitors. They were losing leads before the page even loaded.` — Impact: `Lost contracts.`
2. **Sydney Ranking** — Title: `No Local Visibility` — Metric: `Near Zero` — Description: `The .com domain had no location signals. Google thought they were an American company, not a Sydney business.` — Impact: `Invisible market.`
3. **Trust Score** — Title: `Amateur Perception` — Metric: `Template` — Description: `A company protecting $3.2B in assets. A website that looked like a weekend project. First impressions were killing them.` — Impact: `Failed due diligence.`
4. **Attribution** — Title: `No Lead Capture` — Metric: `0%` — Description: `Enquiries went to a generic inbox. No tracking. No automation. They had no idea which marketing was working.` — Impact: `Marketing blindness.`
