## Section: The Brief
- Headline: `CLIENT: GROUP 7 SECURITY`
- Meta: INDUSTRY: Security Services | SCOPE: Website Rebuild + Local SEO | TIMELINE: 4 Weeks
- Sub: `Group 7 Security protects some of Sydney's most valuable assets. Properties worth over $3.2 billion. But their website made them look like a 1990s template, not a serious security operation. Google didn't know they were in Sydney. Their competitors were taking all the local traffic.`

## Section: The Problem
- Headline: `The Old Site.`
- Label: `group7security.com — DECOMMISSIONED` / `CRITICAL ERROR`
- Items: Load Time — Speed Was Killing Conversions — 4.2 seconds — Google says anything over 3 seconds loses half your mobile visitors. They were losing leads before the page even loaded. — Impact: Lost contracts. | Sydney Ranking — No Local Visibility — Near Zero — The .com domain had no location signals. Google thought they were an American company, not a Sydney business. — Impact: Invisible market. | Trust Score — Amateur Perception — Template — A company protecting $3.2B in assets. A website that looked like a weekend project. First impressions were killing them. — Impact: Failed due diligence. | Attribution — No Lead Capture — 0% — Enquiries went to a generic inbox. No tracking. No automation. They had no idea which marketing was working. — Impact: Marketing blindness.

## Section: The Solution

No WordPress bloat. — Page weight dropped 89%. Load time went from 4.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds. | Local SEO Schema — Added Sydney location tags throughout. — Google now knows exactly where they operate.
