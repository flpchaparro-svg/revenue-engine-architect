No testimonials. Just data. Here's what happened when I rebuilt a Sydney security company's website.

## The Brief
CLIENT: GROUP 7 SECURITY
INDUSTRY: Security Services
SCOPE: Website Rebuild + Local SEO
TIMELINE: 4 Weeks
Group 7 Security protects some of Sydney's most valuable assets. Properties worth over $3.2 billion. But their website made them look like a 1990s template, not a serious security operation. Google didn't know they were in Sydney. Their competitors were taking all the local traffic.

## The Problem
The Old Site.
group7security.com — DECOMMISSIONED
CRITICAL ERROR
Load Time — Speed Was Killing Conversions — 4.2 seconds — Google says anything over 3 seconds loses half your mobile visitors. They were losing leads before the page even loaded. — Impact: Lost contracts.
Sydney Ranking — No Local Visibility — Near Zero — The .com domain had no location signals. Google thought they were an American company, not a Sydney business. — Impact: Invisible market.
Trust Score — Amateur Perception — Template — A company protecting $3.2B in assets. A website that looked like a weekend project. First impressions were killing them. — Impact: Failed due diligence.
Attribution — No Lead Capture — 0% — Enquiries went to a generic inbox. No tracking. No automation. They had no idea which marketing was working. — Impact: Marketing blindness.

## The Solution
The New Standard.
group7security.com.au — LIVE SYSTEM
Domain Migration — Migrated to .com.au with proper redirects. — Google now knows this is an Australian business. Essential for local search.
Performance Architecture — Custom-built. No WordPress bloat. — Page weight dropped 89%. Load time went from 4.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds.
Local SEO Schema — Added Sydney location tags throughout. — Google now knows exactly where they operate. Local searches find them.
Lead Intelligence — Smart forms with source tracking. — They now know exactly which marketing generates enquiries.
