Privacy Policy.
I don't sell your data. I use it to build your system. Here is the plain English explanation of how we handle information.

## 1. The Basics
We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you fill out a form, request an audit, or communicate with us. This typically includes your name, email, phone number, and details about your business systems.

## 2. How We Use Data
We use this data to:
Assess your current technical architecture.
Communicate with you about your project.
Send you the audit results you requested.
We do not sell your data to third-party lead brokers.

## 3. Tools & Infrastructure
Our own system runs on enterprise-grade infrastructure including Vercel, HubSpot, and Google Cloud. Your data is processed securely within these environments.

## 4. Contact
If you want your data deleted from our CRM, just email help@felipechaparro.com and we will wipe it. No questions asked.
