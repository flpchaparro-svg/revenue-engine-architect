/ THE PROCESS
How I Work.
Clear path. No mystery. No jargon. Just results.

## Two Rules
/ HOW I THINK
Two Rules.

01 / CLARITY — If I can't explain it at a pub, it's too complex. — You'll understand every part of your system. If you don't, I haven't done my job.
02 / PEOPLE — If a tool makes your team's day harder, it's failed. — Your team will actually use what I build. Not fight against it.

## The 4 Phases
/ THE 4 PHASES
How Every Project Works.

01 / DIAGNOSE — Find the Leaks — Where does your data get typed twice? Where do your leads go cold? Where does profit disappear? I find it.
02 / DESIGN — Pick the Right Tools — No platform lock-in. I pick what fits your business. We design the logic before writing a single line of code.
03 / BUILD — Build in Sprints — No 6-month projects that drain your budget. Short sprints. You see progress in weeks, not quarters.
04 / HANDOVER — Make It Stick — Software fails when people don't use it. Training materials, support, and check-ins until your team actually adopts it.
