## Section: Two Rules
- Eyebrow: `/ HOW I THINK`
- Headline: `Two Rules.`
- Rule 01: `CLARITY` — If I can't explain it at a pub, it's too complex. — You'll understand every part of your system. If you don't, I haven't done my job.
- Rule 02: `PEOPLE` — If a tool makes your team's day harder, it's failed. — Your team will actually use what I build. Not fight against it.

## Section: The 4 Phases
- Eyebrow: `/ THE 4 PHASES`
- Headline: `How Every Project Works.`
- Phase 01: `DIAGNOSE — Find the Leaks` — Where does your data get typed twice? Where do your leads go cold? Where does profit disappear? I find it.
- Phase 02: `DESIGN — Pick the Right Tools` — No platform lock-in. I pick what fits your business. We design the logic before writing a single line of code.
- Phase 03: `BUILD — Build in Sprints` — No 6-month projects that drain your budget. Short sprints. You see progress in weeks, not quarters.
- Phase 04: `HANDOVER — Make It Stick` — Software fails when people don't use it. Training materials, support, and check-ins until your team actually adopts it.

## Section: CTA
