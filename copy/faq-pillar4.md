# FAQ — Pillar 4: AI Assistants

## 1. What's the difference between a chatbot and an AI assistant?

Old chatbots were dumb. They followed scripts. "Press 1 for sales."

**AI assistants** understand natural language. They answer specific questions. "What time do you open on Sunday?" They learn from your business rules. One is frustrating. The other is helpful.

## 2. Can the AI actually book real appointments?

Yes.

It connects to your calendar. **Google Calendar**. Outlook. Calendly. It checks availability in real-time. A customer asks for a slot. The AI confirms it. No back-and-forth.

## 3. Can I have an AI that answers my phone?

Yes. This is powerful.

An **AI voice agent** answers 24/7. It handles FAQs. It qualifies leads. It books meetings. It sounds human. And it hands off to a real person when needed. It is a **virtual receptionist** that never sleeps.

## 4. What happens if someone asks something the AI doesn't know?

It hands off. Gracefully.

I build **escape routes**. The AI knows its limits. It will say: "Let me connect you with someone who can help." It does not fake knowledge (hallucinate).

## 5. How does the AI learn about my specific business?

I feed it your **knowledge base**.

• FAQ documents.
• Website content.
• Pricing and policies.

We test it. We find gaps. We refine. Most **AI bots** are ready to launch in a few days.
