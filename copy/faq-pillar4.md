## 1. What's the difference between a chatbot and an AI assistant?

Old chatbots were dumb. They followed scripts. "Press 1 for sales."

AI assistants understand language. They answer specific questions. "What time do you open on Sunday?" They learn from your business rules. One is frustrating. The other is helpful.

## 2. Can the AI actually book real appointments?

Yes.

It connects to your calendar. Google. Outlook. Calendly. It checks availability in real-time. A customer asks for a slot. The AI confirms it. No back-and-forth.

## 3. Can I have an AI that answers my phone?

Yes. This is powerful.

An AI voice agent answers 24/7. It handles FAQs. It qualifies leads. It books meetings. It sounds human. And it hands off to a real person when needed. It is a receptionist that never sleeps.

## 4. What happens if someone asks something the AI doesn't know?

It hands off. Gracefully.

I build escape routes. The AI knows its limits. It will say: "Let me connect you with someone who can help." It does not fake knowledge.

## 5. How does the AI learn about my specific business?

I feed it your data.

• FAQ documents.
• Website content.
• Pricing and policies.

We test it. We find gaps. We refine. Most businesses are ready to launch in a few days.
