## 1. What's the difference between a chatbot and an AI assistant?

Old chatbots followed scripts: "Press 1 for sales, press 2 for support." They felt robotic because they were.

AI assistants understand language. They can answer "What time do you open on weekends?" even if you never programmed that exact question. They learn from your FAQ, your website, and your business rules.

The difference is frustrating vs helpful.

## 2. Can the AI actually book real appointments?

Yes. It connects to your calendar (Google, Outlook, Calendly, etc.) and books real appointments in real-time.

A customer asks "Can I see you Tuesday afternoon?" — the AI checks your availability and confirms the booking. No back-and-forth, no manual entry.

## 3. Can I have an AI that answers my phone?

Yes — this is one of the most powerful applications.

An AI voice agent can answer your phone 24/7, handle FAQs, qualify leads, and book appointments. It sounds human (not robotic) and hands off to a real person when needed.

It's like having a receptionist who never sleeps, never gets sick, and never puts someone on hold.

## 4. What happens if someone asks something the AI doesn't know?

It hands off gracefully. I build "escape routes" so the AI knows when to say:

• "Let me connect you with [Name] who can help with that"
• "I'll have someone call you back within [timeframe]"
• "Here's a form to submit your question for a human response"

The AI isn't trying to fake knowledge — it knows its limits.

## 5. How does the AI learn about my specific business?

I feed it your:

• FAQ document (or I create one from your answers)
• Website content
• Product/service information
• Common questions you get asked
• Business rules (hours, pricing, policies)

We test it together, find gaps, and refine. Most businesses are "launch-ready" within a few days of setup.
