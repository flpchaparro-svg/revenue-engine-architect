# FAQ — Pillar 6: Team Training

## 1. My team hates new software. How do you get them to use it?

Resistance comes from fear. They worry it means more work.

I make it easy. **Bite-sized videos**. No long seminars. I show them the benefit. "This saves you two hours a week." I don't disappear after training. I ensure **software adoption**.

## 2. Do you train everyone, or just the manager?

Everyone who uses the system gets trained.

Managers get the strategy view. Staff get the workflow view. You get **SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures) for new hires. No one gets left behind.

## 3. Is training live, or videos, or documents?

A mix.

• **Short videos**: Rewatchable. Specific.
• **Live walkthrough**: For Q&A and rollout.
• **Documentation**: For reference.

I don't do 3-hour webinars. Your team can watch a 3-minute video when they are stuck.

## 4. What happens when I hire someone new after the project?

They use the same materials.

• Video library.
• Docs.
• **Knowledge base**.

You **onboard new staff** without paying me again. The training is yours.

## 5. How long until my team is comfortable with new systems?

Simple tools take a week or two. Complex systems take a month.

We start small. We add features over time. We don't overwhelm them on day one.
