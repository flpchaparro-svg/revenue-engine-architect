## 1. My team hates new software. How do you get them to use it?

Resistance usually comes from fear, not laziness. People worry they'll look stupid, or that the new system is just more work.

I handle this by:
• Making it easy: Bite-sized videos, not 3-hour training sessions
• Showing the benefit: "This saves you 2 hours a week" not "This is the new process"
• Supporting the rollout: I don't disappear after the training — I check that it sticks

Change is hard. But people adopt tools that make their life easier, and resist tools that don't. I build for adoption.

## 2. Do you train everyone, or just the manager?

Everyone who needs to use the system gets trained.

Usually that means:
• Managers get the full picture (strategy, reporting, admin)
• Staff get their specific workflows (what they do day-to-day)
• You get documentation to onboard future hires

Nobody gets left behind wondering "what button do I click?"

## 3. Is training live, or videos, or documents?

Mix of all three:

• Short videos (2-5 min): For specific tasks, rewatchable anytime
• Live walkthrough: For initial rollout, Q&A, edge cases
• Documentation: Step-by-step guides for reference

I don't do 3-hour webinars. Bite-sized is better. Your team can watch a 3-minute video when they're stuck, not schedule a meeting.

## 4. What happens when I hire someone new after the project?

They get the same training materials:

• Video library
• Documentation
• Access to the knowledge base

You can onboard new staff without re-hiring me. The training is yours to keep and reuse.

## 5. How long until my team is comfortable with new systems?

For simple tools: 1-2 weeks of regular use.
For complex systems: 4-6 weeks with ongoing support.

The key is starting with the minimum they need to do their job, then adding features over time. Don't overwhelm them with everything on day one.
