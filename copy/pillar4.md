## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### RESPONDER — "I need to catch missed calls."
- Summary: `You miss calls. Every missed call is a missed opportunity. AI picks up when you can't.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: AI voice agent | Call transcription | SMS follow-up | Calendar booking

- **The Missed Call Business** (Trades, Emergency Services) — Pain: After-Hours Revenue — `Your phone rings at 9pm. You're at dinner with family. That job goes to whoever picks up.` — Fix: `AI answers. Sounds human. Takes their details. Books them into your calendar. You call back in the morning with the job already half-won.`
- **The One-Man Operation** (Solo Tradies, Consultants) — Pain: On the Tools — `You're mid-job. Hands full. Phone rings. You can't answer. Another lead gone.` — Fix: `AI handles it. Gets their name, job details, urgency. Sends you a summary when you're free.`
- **The Overflow Handler** (Clinics, Agencies) — Pain: Peak Time Chaos — `Monday mornings. Phones ring off the hook. Your receptionist can only answer one at a time. The rest go to voicemail.` — Fix: `AI catches the overflow. No hold music. No voicemail. Every call answered instantly.`

### QUALIFIER — "I need to filter leads."
- Summary: `Not every enquiry deserves your time. AI asks the right questions so you know who's worth calling back.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Custom qualification scripts | Lead scoring | CRM integration | Smart routing

- **The Tyre-Kicker Filter** (High-Ticket Sales, Coaches) — Pain: Wasted Quotes — `You quote 10 jobs. 2 convert. The other 8 were never going to buy. You wasted time on all of them.` — Fix: `AI qualifies upfront. Budget? Timeline? Urgency? You only spend time on real opportunities.`
- **The Service Matcher** (Multi-Service Agencies) — Pain: Wrong Enquiries — `Half your calls are for services you don't offer. You explain this 10 times a day.` — Fix: `AI explains your services, redirects if needed, only passes through relevant enquiries.`
- **The Urgency Sorter** (Real Estate, Finance Brokers) — Pain: Everything Feels Equal — `Hot lead and cold lead look the same in your inbox. You treat them equally. You shouldn't.` — Fix: `AI scores urgency. "Needs it this week" gets a different priority than "just browsing."`

### ASSISTANT — "I need AI that knows my business."

Over and over.` — Fix: `AI knows the answers. Customers get instant responses. You never answer the same question twice.`
- **The Internal Helper** (Agency Owners, Operations) — Pain: Staff Interruptions — `Your team asks you questions all day. "Where's that template?" "What's the process for X?" You're everyone's helpdesk.` — Fix: `Internal AI assistant. Staff ask the bot. You get your time back.`

- **The Outreach Agent** (Marketing, Sales) — Pain: Cold Follow-up — `You have 500 old leads. Someone should follow up. Nobody does.` — Fix: `AI reaches out. Personalised messages based on their history. Warm leads resurface without you lifting a finger.`
- **The Project Coordinator** (Agencies, Project Biz) — Pain: Status Chasing — `You spend hours chasing updates. "Where are we on the Smith job?" "Has the supplier confirmed?"` — Fix: `AI chases for you. Sends reminders, collects updates, flags delays. You see a dashboard, not a to-do list.`
