## The System (7 Pillars)
- Phase headers and pillar cards use data below. Each card shows: number, display title, subtitle, category label, body, systemPurpose, and subServices.

### Pillar 01 — THE FACE — Websites & E-commerce
- Category: GET CLIENTS
- Body: `Your website is the front door.`
- System purpose: `Stop losing leads.`
- **How it connects:** `Your website is the front door. When someone fills out a form, that data goes straight to your CRM. No inbox. No copy-pasting. The lead exists in your system before they've closed the browser.`
- **What this unlocks:** `Your CRM knows where they came from. Your automation can respond instantly. Your dashboard can track which pages actually bring in money.`
- Card (from constants): Title `WEBSITES & E-COMMERCE` · Symptom `Are you losing leads in spreadsheets?` · Description `Most websites just sit there. Yours should be catching leads while you sleep. I build sites that capture enquiries, process sales, and feed your CRM automatically.` · Features: Smart Lead Forms | Inventory Synced to Sales | Fast, Mobile-First Design

### Pillar 02 — THE BRAIN — CRM & Lead Tracking
- Category: GET CLIENTS
- Body: `Your CRM is the memory.`
- System purpose: `Stop losing leads.`
- **How it connects:** `Your CRM is the memory. Everything your website catches lands here. When you move a deal forward, automation knows. When you win a job, invoices get sent. When something stalls, you get reminded.`
- **What this unlocks:** `Your AI assistant can read the CRM before a call and know who's ringing. Your dashboard can show pipeline and forecast. Nothing lives in your head anymore.`
- Card: Title `CRM & LEAD TRACKING` · Symptom `Do you know exactly where every deal is stuck?` · Description `How many leads slipped through last month? If you don't know, that's the problem. Every lead, every call, every deal logged in one place.` · Features: Visual Deal Pipeline | Clean Data | Auto Follow-Up Reminders

### Pillar 03 — THE MUSCLE — Automation
- Category: GET CLIENTS
- Body: `Automation is the speed.`
- System purpose: `Stop losing leads.`
- **How it connects:** `Automation is the speed. When a lead comes in, it replies. When a deal closes, it invoices. When someone forgets to follow up, it chases. It watches your CRM and acts without you lifting a finger.`
- **What this unlocks:** `Your website and CRM become a machine that runs while you sleep. You stop doing admin. Your team stops forgetting things.`
- Card: Title `AUTOMATION` · Symptom `Are you manually typing invoices and contracts?` · Description `Still typing the same data into three different apps? There's a better way. Invoices, follow-ups, data entry. All running without you.` · Features: Instant Data Sync | Smart Email Sequences | Auto-Generated Invoices

### Pillar 04 — THE VOICE — AI Assistants
- Category: SCALE FASTER
- Body: `AI handles overflow.`
- System purpose: `Do more without hiring more.`
- **How it connects:** `AI handles overflow. When your content brings traffic and your website captures leads, AI picks up the phone. It reads your CRM to know who's calling. After the call, it updates the record. You never touched it.`
- **What this unlocks:** `You double your lead volume without hiring. Your CRM stays updated without your team doing data entry. Nights and weekends are covered.`
- Card: Title `AI ASSISTANTS` · Symptom `Is your team answering the same 5 questions all day?` · Description `How many calls did you miss last month? Each one could've been a job. AI answers your phone, qualifies leads, and books appointments. 24/7. Sounds human. Never gets sick.` · Features: AI Phone Answering | Internal Knowledge Bots | Built-In Safety Rules

### Pillar 05 — THE PRESENCE — Content Systems
- Category: SCALE FASTER
- Body: `Content fills the top of the funnel.`
- System purpose: `Do more without hiring more.`
- **How it connects:** `Content fills the top of the funnel. More content means more traffic. More traffic means more leads hitting your website. More leads means more work for your CRM, automation, and AI to handle.`
- **What this unlocks:** `You stay visible without posting every day. Your website has something to catch. The rest of the system has fuel to run on.`
- Card: Title `CONTENT SYSTEMS` · Symptom `Is content creation taking hours instead of minutes?` · Description `You know you should be posting. But when? Talk for 10 minutes. Get a month of posts, blogs, and emails. The system does the rest.` · Features: AI Voice & Video Cloning | Auto-Post to All Platforms | YouTube & Podcast Setup

### Pillar 06 — THE SOUL — Team Training
- Category: SCALE FASTER
- Body: `Training protects everything else.`
- System purpose: `Do more without hiring more.`

- **What this unlocks:** `The tools you paid for actually get used. Data stays clean. Your dashboard tells the truth. Nothing becomes expensive shelfware.`
- Card: Title `TEAM TRAINING` · Symptom `Did you buy software that nobody uses?` · Description `Bought software your team never uses? You're not alone. Most tech fails here. Short videos.

- Card: Title `DASHBOARDS & REPORTING` · Symptom `Are you steering the business by gut feeling?` · Description `Do you actually know your margin right now? Or are you waiting for the accountant?
