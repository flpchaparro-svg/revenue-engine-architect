SYDNEY BUSINESS AUTOMATION [scramble: ARCHITECT / NAVIGATOR / ENGINEER]
Stop Doing
Everyone's Job.
You didn't start a business to chase invoices, re-type data, and answer the same questions all day. Your time is worth more than that. I build systems that handle the boring stuff so you can focus on the work that actually grows your revenue.

## Problem Section
01 / THE PROBLEM
You didn't start your business to become an administrative hostage.

02 / SYMPTOMS
The Bottleneck Boss — Your team asks you 20 questions a day. They could just do the work. But they wait for you instead.
The Double-Entry Tax — The same customer details get typed into three apps by three people. Every. Single. Day.
The Sunday Dread — Your weekend disappears into invoicing and admin. Your family waits.

03 / THE COST
YOUR BEST PEOPLE ARE BORED
You're paying skilled staff to do unskilled work. They get bored. They leave. You hire again. The cycle repeats.

04 / THE FIX
Your team gets their time back. You get your business back. The boring work runs itself.

## Friction Audit
/ THE FRICTION AUDIT
Where your week disappears.
Your business isn't broken. But it is leaking. These are the 4 places where time and money vanish before you notice.
AUDIT PROGRESS

Leads Go Cold — HOURS, NOT MINUTES — Someone fills out your contact form. You see it the next day. By then, they've called your competitor. Speed wins jobs. You're too slow.
The Copy-Paste Loop — SAME DATA, THREE TIMES — Sales types it. Ops types it again. Finance types it a third time. You're paying three salaries for one job. The errors multiply.
You Are The Bottleneck — EVERYTHING WAITS FOR YOU — Your phone buzzes all day with questions only you can answer. Deep work? Forget it. You're everyone's helpdesk.
Flying Without Instruments — NO REAL-TIME NUMBERS — You know your revenue. But not your real margin. You wait for your accountant to tell you if last month was good or bad. Too late to fix it by then.

You've seen the leak.

## The System (7 Pillars)
/ THE SYSTEM
7 Pillars. 3 Outcomes.
Some businesses need everything built from scratch. Some just need one piece fixed. Each service works alone. But they're built to connect when you're ready.

PHASE 01 / GET CLIENTS — The Capture Loop — Your website catches leads. Your CRM holds them. Automation chases them. Nothing slips through. — VIEW SYSTEM
PHASE 02 / SCALE FASTER — The Multiplier — Content fills your funnel. AI handles the overflow. Training keeps your team sharp. You grow without burning out. — VIEW SYSTEM
PHASE 03 / SEE CLEARLY — The Control Room — One dashboard. Live data. You see what's working. You fix what's broken. Before it costs you money. — VIEW SYSTEM

01 WEBSITES & E-COMMERCE — Most websites just sit there. Yours should be catching leads while you sleep. I build sites that capture enquiries, process sales, and feed your CRM automatically. — Smart Lead Forms, Inventory Synced to Sales, Fast Mobile-First Design
02 CRM & LEAD TRACKING — How many leads slipped through last month? If you don't know, that's the problem. Every lead, every call, every deal logged in one place. — Visual Deal Pipeline, Clean Data, Auto Follow-Up Reminders
03 AUTOMATION — Still typing the same data into three different apps? There's a better way. Invoices, follow-ups, data entry. All running without you. — Instant Data Sync, Smart Email Sequences, Auto-Generated Invoices
04 AI ASSISTANTS — How many calls did you miss last month? Each one could've been a job. AI answers your phone, qualifies leads, and books appointments. 24/7. Sounds human. Never gets sick. — AI Phone Answering, Internal Knowledge Bots, Built-In Safety Rules
05 CONTENT SYSTEMS — You know you should be posting. But when? Talk for 10 minutes. Get a month of posts, blogs, and emails. The system does the rest. — AI Voice & Video Cloning, Auto-Post to All Platforms, YouTube & Podcast Setup
06 TEAM TRAINING — Bought software your team never uses? You're not alone. Most tech fails here. Short videos. Clear guides. Support until they actually use it. — Bite-Sized Training Videos, Step-by-Step Guides, Team Q&A Library
07 DASHBOARDS & REPORTING — Do you actually know your margin right now? Or are you waiting for the accountant? Revenue, margin, and pipeline on one screen. Updated live. — Live Revenue Tracking, Forecasting & Projections, One-Screen Business Health

## The Architect (home block)
/ VIEW MODE
THE ARCHITECT | THE HUMAN
FELIPE CHAPARRO / SYDNEY

THE ARCHITECT: One person. Ten person output. — No account managers. No junior handoffs. No endless meetings. You talk directly to the person building your system. Automation and AI let me deliver what agencies charge a team for.
THE HUMAN: I've run businesses. Not just advised them. — Before I built systems for others, I ran my own café, managed international franchises, and worked factory floors. I know what it's like to chase invoices at midnight. No theory. Just what actually works.

## Case Study (Group 7) — card + modal
/ REAL RESULTS
See It In Action.
Don't take my word for it. Here's what happened when I rebuilt a Sydney security company's website.

Card: WEBSITE REBUILD | SEE THE TRANSFORMATION — group7security.com 4.2s Load | group7security.com.au 0.4s Load — VIEW TRANSFORMATION — SEE FULL CASE STUDY

Modal: Case Study: Group 7 Security — WEBSITE + SEO OVERHAUL
BEFORE: Old .com Site | AFTER: New .com.au Site
BUILD LOG / WHAT I DID
> Added Sydney location tags for Google... [DONE]
> Removed slow code... [SAVED 2.1MB]
> Load time: 4.2s → 0.4s [10x FASTER]
THE PROBLEM: Slow .com website with no local SEO. Google thought they were a global tech company, not a Sydney security firm. Local customers couldn't find them.
WHAT I DID: Migrated to .com.au. Rebuilt from scratch. Fast, mobile-first, with Sydney location tags so Google knows exactly where they operate.
THE RESULT: Page load dropped from 4.2s to 0.4s. Local rankings improved. The site now converts visitors instead of losing them.
