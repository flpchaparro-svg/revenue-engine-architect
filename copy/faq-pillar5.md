## 1. Do I have to be on camera for this to work?

No. Content systems work with whatever you're comfortable with:

• Voice notes: You talk, I turn it into blogs and social posts
• Written notes: You send bullet points, I expand them
• Interviews: I ask questions, you answer, we create from that

The goal is extracting your expertise with minimum friction. If you hate video, we won't do video.

## 2. Can you create content that sounds like me?

Yes — that's the whole point. AI can now clone your voice (for audio) and writing style (for text) so content sounds like you, not a generic marketing agency.

We'll calibrate the tone based on examples you like. If something doesn't sound right, we adjust.

## 3. How much content can this system produce?

From a single 30-minute interview or voice note, we can create:

• 1 long-form blog post
• 5-10 social media posts
• 1 email newsletter
• 1 YouTube script or podcast episode
• Quote graphics and snippets

One input → many outputs. That's the "supply chain" approach to content.

## 4. Does this replace my marketing team or agency?

It depends on what they do:

• Content creation: This system handles that
• Strategy and planning: You still need a human brain for that
• Paid ads: Separate skillset, not covered here
• Social engagement: Responding to comments is still human work

Think of this as a content production line, not a full marketing department.

• LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X

• Email newsletters
