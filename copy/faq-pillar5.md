# FAQ — Pillar 5: Content Systems

## 1. Do I have to be on camera for this to work?

No. We work with your strengths.

• **Voice notes**: You talk. I turn it into text.
• **Written notes**: You send bullets. I expand them.
• **Interviews**: I ask. You answer.

We extract your expertise. If you hate video, we don't do video.

## 2. Can you create content that sounds like me?

Yes. That is the point.

AI can now **clone your voice** and your **writing style**. The content will sound like you. Not like a generic marketing agency. We calibrate the tone until it fits.

## 3. How much content can this system produce?

A lot. Fast.

One 30-minute interview can become:
• 1 long-form **blog post**.
• 5 **social media posts**.
• 1 newsletter.
• 1 script.

One input. Many outputs. It is a **content supply chain**.

## 4. Does this replace my marketing team or agency?

It depends.

It replaces the grunt work of creation. It does not replace high-level **content strategy**. It does not replace community management. Think of this as a production line. Not a department.

## 5. Which social platforms can this post to?

Most of them.

• **LinkedIn**.
• Facebook.
• Instagram.
• Twitter/X.
• YouTube.
• Your blog.

We set up **auto-posting**. You approve once. It goes everywhere.
