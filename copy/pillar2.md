## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### CAPTURE — "I keep losing leads."
- Summary: `You have a website but no idea where your leads go. They land in an inbox. Sometimes you remember to check it.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: HubSpot or Pipedrive setup | Lead source tracking | Auto-reply email | Admin notification

- **The Inbox Manager** (Solo Consultants, Small Agencies) — Pain: Unknown ROI — `You spend $1,000 on ads but don't know if the phone rang because of the ad or a referral. You're guessing with your wallet.` — Fix: `Source tracking. The CRM tells you "John Smith came from Google Ads." You know exactly which marketing pays your bills.`
- **The Blind Advertiser** (Local Services, Tradies) — Pain: Lost Attribution — `You run Facebook ads, Google ads, referrals, and word of mouth. Something works. You just don't know what.` — Fix: `Every lead tagged with where they came from. You stop wasting money on channels that don't convert.`
- **The Slow Responder** (Real Estate, Finance Brokers) — Pain: Cold Leads — `Leads come in. You reply when you can. Sometimes that's 3 days later. By then, they've hired someone else.` — Fix: `Auto-reply within 10 seconds. They know you got their message. You get time to call back properly.`

### NURTURE — "My leads go cold."
- Summary: `You capture leads but they go quiet. No follow-up system. Deals die in silence.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Email sequences | Task reminders | Deal pipeline | Activity tracking

- **The Forgetter** (Solar Sales, Enterprise SaaS) — Pain: Lost Follow-ups — `You quoted someone last month. Meant to follow up. Forgot. They went with your competitor.` — Fix: `Automatic reminders. If you haven't touched a deal in 7 days, the system nudges you. Nothing falls through.`
- **The Spreadsheet Warrior** (E-commerce, Authors) — Pain: Chaos Management — `Your leads live in a spreadsheet, your emails, sticky notes, and your head. Good luck finding that quote from March.` — Fix: `One place. Every lead, every email, every note. Search "plumber Bondi" and find them in 2 seconds.`
- **The Ghost Hunter** (Multi-Service Agencies) — Pain: Silent Prospects — `People enquire, you send a quote, then silence. You don't know if they're thinking or they've moved on.` — Fix: `Automatic follow-up emails at day 3, 7, and 14. Gentle nudges that bring deals back from the dead.`

### PIPELINE — "I can't see my deals."
- Summary: `You have leads but no visibility. How much is in your pipeline? What's closing this month? You're guessing.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Visual pipeline | Revenue forecasting | Win/loss tracking | Team visibility

- **The Revenue Guesser** (Solar Sales, Enterprise SaaS) — Pain: No Forecast — `"How much will we close this month?" You shrug. You genuinely don't know.` — Fix: `A pipeline that shows every deal, its value, and its probability. You know what's coming before it lands.`
- **The Manager in the Dark** (Teams of 3+ Reps) — Pain: Team Blindness — `Your sales team says they're busy. But are they? You have no idea what they're actually working on.` — Fix: `Full visibility. See every deal, every activity, every conversation. No more "trust me, I'm on it."`
- **The One-Man Band** (Construction, Events) — Pain: Head Storage — `Everything lives in your head. If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, the business stops.` — Fix: `Everything documented. Deals, contacts, history. Your business survives without your memory.`

### REVOPS — "I need everything connected."
- Summary: `You have systems but they don't talk to each other. CRM here, accounting there, operations somewhere else.`
- Sprint: `21 DAYS`
- Specs: CRM to accounting sync | Inventory integration | Custom dashboards | Multi-team workflows

- **The Double-Entry Victim** (Mid-Market Companies $5M+) — Pain: Data Everywhere — `A deal closes in the CRM. Someone types it into Xero. Someone else types it into the project system. Three chances for error.` — Fix: `Close a deal, invoice auto-generates in Xero, project auto-creates in Monday. One entry. Zero mistakes.`
- **The Information Silo** (SaaS, Membership Sites) — Pain: Disconnected Teams — `Sales doesn't know what operations promised. Operations doesn't know what sales sold. Clients get caught in the middle.` — Fix: `One source of truth. Deal notes flow to operations. Everyone sees the same information.`
- **The Scaling Business** (Financial Services, Insurance) — Pain: Breaking Systems — `What worked with 5 staff breaks with 15. Your processes can't handle the growth.` — Fix: `Systems built to scale. Add staff, add deals, add complexity. The CRM handles it.`
