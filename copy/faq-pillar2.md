## 1. My team hated our last CRM. What's different?

Most CRMs fail because they create work. I design systems that remove it.

Data enters automatically. From forms. From emails. From calls. Your team won't type things twice. When the **CRM system** saves them time, they use it.

And I include training. Everyone will know what to do. No guessing.

## 2. Can you connect the CRM to Xero / MYOB?

Yes. It is a standard **sales automation**.

A deal closes in your CRM. The system creates an invoice in Xero. No re-typing names. No error. **One source of truth**.

## 3. Which CRM do you recommend?

I use what works. Usually **HubSpot CRM** for small-to-medium businesses.

It is powerful. It has a free tier. It integrates with everything. For complex needs, we might look at **Pipedrive** or **Salesforce**. I recommend the best fit for you.

## 4. What happens to our data if a staff member quits?

This is why you need a **centralized CRM**.

If leads live in a notebook or personal email, they leave when the person leaves. With a proper system, every lead is logged. Staff come and go. Your **customer data** stays.

## 5. Can you migrate my existing contacts from spreadsheets?

Yes. **CRM data migration** is part of the deal.

I help you consolidate contacts. We pull them from spreadsheets or old systems. We clean them up. Then we import. You start with a **clean database**.
