## 1. My team hated our last CRM. What's different?

Most CRM setups fail because they add MORE work instead of removing it.

I design systems where data enters automatically (from forms, emails, calls) so your team isn't typing things twice. When the CRM saves them time instead of costing it, they actually use it.

Plus, I include training. Your team will know exactly what to do — no guessing.

## 2. Can you connect the CRM to Xero / MYOB?

Yes. That's one of the most common automations I build.

When a deal closes in your CRM, it can automatically create an invoice in Xero — no re-typing names, amounts, or details. One source of truth, no double-entry.

## 3. Which CRM do you recommend?

I'm tool-agnostic, but my go-to is usually HubSpot for small-to-medium businesses. It's powerful, has a free tier, and integrates with almost everything.

For larger or more complex needs, we might look at Salesforce, Pipedrive, or industry-specific tools. I'll recommend what fits your situation, not what pays me the biggest commission.

## 4. What happens to our data if a staff member quits?

This is exactly why CRM matters. If leads live in someone's personal notebook or email, they leave when that person does.

With a proper CRM, every lead, every conversation, every deal is logged in the system. Staff come and go — your data stays.

## 5. Can you migrate my existing contacts from spreadsheets?

Yes. Data migration is part of the setup.

I'll help you consolidate contacts from wherever they live — spreadsheets, old systems, email exports — and clean them up before importing. You start with a tidy database, not a mess.
