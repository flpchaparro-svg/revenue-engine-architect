## 1. What kinds of things can you actually automate?

Anything repetitive. Common examples:

• Sending follow-up emails after an enquiry
• Creating invoices when a job is marked complete
• Notifying your team when a high-value lead comes in
• Syncing data between systems (CRM → accounting → project management)
• Sending appointment reminders via SMS
• Generating quotes from form submissions

If you're doing the same task more than 5 times a week, it's probably automatable.

## 2. What happens if the automation breaks?

It can — which is why I build with monitoring and alerts.

If something fails (like an API connection drops), you'll know immediately. Most issues are quick fixes. And because you own the system, you can hire anyone to maintain it — including me if you want ongoing support.

## 3. How do I know which task to automate first?

We start with the highest-impact, lowest-risk automation:

• High impact: Saves the most time or prevents the most errors
• Low risk: Won't break critical business processes if something goes wrong

Usually that's something like auto-replies to enquiries, invoice generation, or data sync between two systems. Quick wins build confidence.

## 4. Will automated emails sound generic and robotic?

Not if they're written properly. I write email sequences that sound like a human wrote them — because the content comes from you, I just automate the delivery.

We can personalise based on name, company, what page they visited, how they enquired. The recipient won't know it was automated.

## 5. What automation tools do you work with?

My go-to stack is:

• Make.com (formerly Integromat) — Visual workflow builder
• Zapier — Simple integrations
• n8n — For more complex, custom workflows
• Native integrations — Direct connections built into tools like HubSpot

I pick the tool that fits the job. Sometimes a $20/month Zapier plan is enough. Sometimes you need something more powerful.
