# FAQ — Pillar 3: Automation

## 1. What kinds of things can you actually automate?

Anything repetitive.

• Sending **follow-up emails**.
• **Automated invoicing**.
• Notifying your team of new leads.
• Syncing data between systems.
• **SMS reminders**.

If you do it more than 5 times a week, a **bot** should do it.

## 2. What happens if the automation breaks?

It can happen. So I build with **error monitoring**.

If a connection drops, I get an alert. We fix it immediately. You own the system. You can hire anyone to maintain it. Or I can handle it.

## 3. How do I know which task to automate first?

We look for **high impact** and **low risk**.

High impact saves time. Low risk means your business won't stop if the bot pauses. We usually start with **auto-replies** or **invoice generation**. Quick wins build confidence.

## 4. Will automated emails sound generic and robotic?

Only if you write like a robot.

The content comes from you. I just **automate the delivery**. We personalize based on names and actions. The recipient won't know a machine sent it.

## 5. What automation tools do you work with?

I use the best stack for the job.

• **Make.com** (formerly Integromat) for complex flows.
• **Zapier** for simple connections.
• **n8n** for custom workflows.
• **Native integrations**.

Sometimes a cheap Zapier plan is enough. Sometimes you need power. I choose what fits.
