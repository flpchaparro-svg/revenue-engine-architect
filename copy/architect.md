## Section: THE HUMAN mode

- Items: Trained as a Chemist — In Chile, I learned that every problem needs a custom process. No templates. Just problem-solving. | Ran My Own Café — Hiring, payroll, marketing, chasing invoices. I know what running a business actually costs. | Managed a Franchise — Fitness franchise in Southeast Asia. I learned to adapt systems to people, not force people into systems. | Now I Build Systems — The systems I wish I'd had when I was running my café. So you can focus on work that matters.
