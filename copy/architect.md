- Timeline:
  1. **Trained as a Chemist** — `In Chile, I learned that every problem needs a custom process. No templates. Just problem-solving.`
  2. **Ran My Own Café** — `I did everything — hiring, payroll, marketing, chasing invoices. I know what running a business actually costs.`
  3. **Managed a Franchise** — `I ran a fitness franchise in Southeast Asia. I learned to adapt systems to people, not force people into systems.`
  4. **Now I Build Systems** — `I build the systems I wish I'd had when I was running my café. So you can focus on the work that matters.`
