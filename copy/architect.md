THE ARCHITECT | THE HUMAN

## THE ARCHITECT mode
One person. Ten person output.
No account managers. No junior handoffs. No endless meetings. You talk directly to the person building your system. Automation and AI let me deliver what agencies charge a team for.

No Templates — Every solution is built for your specific situation. Nothing copy-pasted.
No Shortcuts — I trained as a chemist. If you miss a step, the reaction fails. Same with business systems.
Enterprise Tools — Same platforms as large agencies. HubSpot. Make.com. Sized for real businesses.
Your Time Back — If your sales team is doing data entry, something is broken. I fix that.

## THE HUMAN mode
I've run businesses. Not just consulted them.
Before I built systems for others, I ran my own café, managed international franchises, and worked factory floors. I know what it's like to chase invoices at midnight. No theory. Just what actually works.

Trained as a Chemist — In Chile, I learned that every problem needs a custom process. No templates. Just problem-solving.
Ran My Own Café — Hiring, payroll, marketing, chasing invoices. I know what running a business actually costs.
Managed a Franchise — Fitness franchise in Southeast Asia. I learned to adapt systems to people, not force people into systems.
Now I Build Systems — The systems I wish I'd had when I was running my café. So you can focus on work that matters.
