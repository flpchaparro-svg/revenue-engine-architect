## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### LINEAR — "I need things to connect."
- Summary: `You're copying and pasting data between apps. Email, spreadsheet, phone contacts. System A doesn't talk to System B.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: App connections via Make.com | Data sync | Notifications | Basic triggers

- **The Copy-Paster** (Solo Founders, Consultants) — Pain: The Data Entry Tax — `You spend 5 hours a week moving data from website forms into your phone contacts or a spreadsheet. Boring, prone to error, and a waste of your talent.` — Fix: `Linear bridges. Someone fills a form? They instantly appear in your contacts, your spreadsheet, and you get a Slack notification. One entry. Three places.`
- **The Late Responder** (Trades, Emergency Services) — Pain: Delayed Replies — `Someone enquires at 9pm. You see it at 8am. By then, they've moved on.` — Fix: `Instant auto-reply. They get acknowledgment in seconds. You follow up when you're ready.`
- **The Paper Shuffler** (Event Planners, Admin) — Pain: Manual Documents — `You type the same client details into quotes, invoices, and contracts. Over and over.` — Fix: `One entry, documents auto-populate. Client name, address, scope. All filled automatically.`

### LOGIC — "I need rules and routing."
- Summary: `Not every lead is the same. Some need urgent calls. Some need nurturing. You need smart routing.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Conditional logic | Lead scoring | Smart routing | Escalation rules

- **The Overwhelmed Responder** (Agencies, Multi-Service Biz) — Pain: Everything Feels Urgent — `You treat every enquiry the same. But a $50k project and a $500 job shouldn't get the same response time.` — Fix: `Lead scoring. Big deal? Instant SMS to you. Small enquiry? Auto-email and queue for later.`
- **The Manual Router** (High-Ticket Sales, Coaches) — Pain: Wrong Person Gets It — `Leads land in a shared inbox. Someone claims it. Sometimes two people claim it. Sometimes nobody does.` — Fix: `Smart routing. Sydney enquiry goes to the Sydney rep. Commercial job goes to commercial team. Automatically.`
- **The Approval Bottleneck** (Real Estate, Sales Teams) — Pain: Everything Waits for You — `Every quote needs your sign-off. You're the bottleneck. Deals wait while you're in meetings.` — Fix: `Auto-approval for quotes under $5k. Only big deals need your eyes. You focus on what matters.`

### ENGINE — "I need full workflows."
- Summary: `You need end-to-end automation. Lead comes in, gets qualified, gets quoted, gets invoiced. Minimal human touch.`
- Sprint: `21 DAYS`
- Specs: Multi-step workflows | CRM to accounting sync | Document generation | Handoff automation

- **The Workflow Builder** (Agencies, Contractors) — Pain: Too Many Steps — `A deal closes. Someone updates the CRM. Someone creates a project. Someone sends an invoice. Someone notifies the team. Four people, four chances to forget.` — Fix: `One trigger, everything happens. Deal closes. Project created. Invoice sent. Team notified. Zero manual steps.`
- **The Invoice Chaser** (SaaS, Service Providers) — Pain: Late Payments — `You send invoices. You forget to follow up. You check the bank in 60 days and wonder why they haven't paid.` — Fix: `Auto-reminders at day 7, 14, 21. Escalation at 30 days. You never chase an invoice manually again.`
- **The Handoff Fumbler** (Subscription Biz, Retainers) — Pain: Lost in Transition — `Sales closes a deal. Operations doesn't know. Client waits. Everyone looks bad.` — Fix: `Automatic handoff. Deal closes, operations gets the brief, client gets onboarding email. Same minute.`

### AGENTIC — "I need intelligent workers."
- Summary: `Beyond simple automations. You need AI that reads, thinks, and acts. Intelligent workers that make decisions.`
- Sprint: `30+ DAYS`
- Specs: AI decision-making | Document parsing | Adaptive workflows | Continuous learning

- **The Document Processor** (Founders, Consultants) — Pain: Manual Extraction — `You receive purchase orders by email. Someone reads them, types the details into your system. Hours every week.` — Fix: `AI reads the PDF, extracts the data, creates the order in your system. You just approve.`
- **The Exception Handler** (Legal, Medical, Research) — Pain: Edge Cases — `Your automations break when something unexpected happens. You end up fixing things manually anyway.` — Fix: `Adaptive logic. AI spots the exception, flags it, suggests a fix. It learns from every edge case.`
- **The Night Shift** (E-commerce, Tech Support) — Pain: After-Hours Gaps — `Business happens 24/7. Your team works 9-5. Opportunities slip through overnight.` — Fix: `Intelligent workers that operate around the clock. They qualify, respond, and escalate. You sleep.`
