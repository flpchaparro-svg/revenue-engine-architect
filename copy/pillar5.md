## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### MEDIA — "I need them to listen."
- Summary: `Your team is on the road. They ignore written emails. You need training they can consume while driving.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: Audio/video production | Podcast setup | Distribution | Basic editing

- **The Fleet Manager** (Logistics, Couriers, Removalists) — Pain: The Unread Bulletin — `You send critical safety updates via email knowing 90% of your drivers never open them. Important information hits the bin, not the brain.` — Fix: `Audio bulletins they can listen to in the truck. Same information, actually consumed.`
- **The Field Director** (Construction, Site Managers) — Pain: Site Briefings — `Your site managers need updates but they're never at a desk. Emails pile up unread.` — Fix: `Short voice updates they play on the drive to site. Information that actually lands.`
- **The Trainer** (RTOs, Induction Programs) — Pain: Training Fatigue — `You run the same induction 20 times a year. Same slides. Same questions. Same waste of your time.` — Fix: `Record once. New staff watch on demand. You do the interesting parts, not the repetition.`

### MATRIX — "I need them to do it right."
- Summary: `Your team needs step-by-step guides. Visual instructions for complex processes.`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: SOP creation | Screen recording | Visual guides | Knowledge base

- **The Process Owner** (Operations, Finance) — Pain: Tribal Knowledge — `Only Sarah knows how to run the end-of-month process. If Sarah's sick, everyone waits.` — Fix: `Documented SOPs with screen recordings. Anyone can follow the process. Sarah takes a holiday.`
- **The Quality Controller** (Manufacturing, Services) — Pain: Inconsistent Output — `Your team does things 5 different ways. Some good. Some terrible. Quality depends on who's working.` — Fix: `One documented way. Visual guides that show exactly how it's done. Consistency improves overnight.`
- **The Onboarder** (HR, Growth Companies) — Pain: Slow Ramp-up — `New hires take 3 months to get productive. You don't have capacity to train them properly.` — Fix: `Self-serve training library. They watch, they practice, they ask questions. Productive in weeks, not months.`

### VISUALS — "I need to explain the complex."
- Summary: `You need to communicate complex ideas simply. Visuals, animations, explainers that make sense.`
- Sprint: `21 DAYS`
- Specs: Motion graphics | Explainer videos | Infographics | Presentation design

- **The Technical Seller** (B2B, SaaS, Engineering) — Pain: Lost in Translation — `Your product is complex. By the time you explain it, their eyes have glazed over.` — Fix: `Animated explainer that shows the value in 60 seconds. They get it before you start talking.`
- **The Proposal Writer** (Agencies, Consultants) — Pain: Boring Documents — `Your proposals are walls of text. Clients skim them. Your best work gets ignored.` — Fix: `Visual proposals with infographics and clear sections. They actually read it.`
- **The Internal Communicator** (Change Management, IT) — Pain: Change Resistance — `You're rolling out a new system. Staff are skeptical. They don't understand why.` — Fix: `Internal launch video that explains the "why" not just the "what." Buy-in before rollout.`

### ANALYST — "I need them to stop asking me."
- Summary: `Your team keeps asking for updates. You need self-serve reporting that answers their questions.`
- Sprint: `30+ DAYS`
- Specs: Interactive dashboards | Automated reports | Custom views | Training on data

- **The Report Generator** (Finance, Operations) — Pain: Monthly Dread — `Every month you build the same reports. Hours of copy-paste from 5 different systems.` — Fix: `Automated reports that build themselves. You review and send. No more building from scratch.`
- **The Question Fielder** (Leadership, Managers) — Pain: Data Requests — `"What were sales last week?" "How many jobs did we complete?" You're everyone's report machine.` — Fix: `Self-serve dashboards. They log in, they see the numbers. You stop answering the same questions.`
- **The Insight Hunter** (Strategy, Growth) — Pain: Data Overload — `You have data everywhere but no insights. Numbers without meaning.` — Fix: `Dashboards that highlight what matters. Anomalies flagged. Trends visible. Action, not just data.`
