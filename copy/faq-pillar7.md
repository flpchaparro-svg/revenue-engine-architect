# FAQ — Pillar 7: Dashboards & Reporting

## 1. How is a dashboard different from reports in Xero or MYOB?

Accounting software shows history. Money in. Money out.

A **dashboard** shows the future. It shows where leads come from. It shows bottlenecks. It shows **pipeline forecasts**. It is the windshield. Not the rearview mirror.

## 2. Can I check my dashboard from my phone?

Yes.

I build for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Check your **business KPIs** from a café. Or the train. **Real-time data**. No laptop needed.

---

## 3. What systems can feed into the dashboard?

Almost anything.

• CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce).
• Accounting (Xero, MYOB).
• Ads (Google, Meta).
• Spreadsheets.

If it has data, we can **visualize it**.

## 4. Is the data live, or does it update once a day?

It depends on you.

Sales pipelines should be **real-time**. Financial summaries can be daily. We decide what needs to be instant. More frequency means more complexity.

---

## 5. Can I have different views for different people?

Yes. **Role-based dashboards** are standard.

The CEO sees cash flow. The Sales Manager sees deals. Marketing sees lead sources. Everyone sees what they need. Nothing more.
