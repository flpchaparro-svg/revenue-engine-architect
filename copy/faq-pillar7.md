## 1. How is a dashboard different from reports in Xero or MYOB?

Accounting software shows you money in, money out. That's history.

A dashboard shows you:
• Where leads are coming from (so you know what marketing works)
• How long deals take to close (so you spot bottlenecks)
• Who your best customers are (so you focus on them)
• Forecasts based on your pipeline (so you plan ahead)

It's the difference between looking in the rearview mirror and looking through the windshield.

## 2. Can I check my dashboard from my phone?

Yes. I build dashboards that work on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

You can check your business health from anywhere — on the train, at a café, on holiday (if you must). Real-time numbers, no laptop required.

## 3. What systems can feed into the dashboard?

Almost anything:

• CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
• Accounting (Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks)
• E-commerce (Shopify, WooCommerce)
• Marketing (Google Analytics, Meta Ads, Mailchimp)
• Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel)
• Custom databases

If it has an API or exports data, it can feed your dashboard.

## 4. Is the data live, or does it update once a day?

It depends on the source and your needs:

• Real-time: For sales pipelines, website traffic, critical metrics
• Hourly: For most business metrics
• Daily: For slower-moving data like financial summaries

We decide together what needs to be instant vs what can be daily. More frequent updates = higher complexity/cost.

## 5. Can I have different views for different people?

Yes. Role-based dashboards are common:

• Owner/CEO: High-level metrics, cash flow, overall health
• Sales manager: Pipeline, deals, rep performance
• Marketing: Lead sources, campaign performance
• Operations: Workload, capacity, delivery metrics

Everyone sees what they need — no more, no less.
