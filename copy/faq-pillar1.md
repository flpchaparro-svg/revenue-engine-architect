## 1. What's the difference between your website tiers?

It comes down to what you need and how long it takes:

• Starter (7 days): A simple site that captures leads. For tradies and local service businesses.
• E-commerce (14 days): An online store with inventory, payments, and shipping.
• Professional (21 days): A fast, secure site for high-ticket services.
• Flagship (30+ days): Custom builds with 3D, animation, and special features.

I'll help you pick the right one. I don't upsell.

## 2. Will my website work properly on mobile?

Yes — and not as an afterthought. I design mobile-first because that's where most of your visitors are (often 70%+).

Your site will load fast, look good, and work properly on phones. If someone fills out a form on their phone at 11pm, it works.

## 3. Do you handle SEO?

I build with SEO foundations baked in — fast loading, proper structure, local business tags, mobile-friendly.

I don't do ongoing SEO campaigns (content writing, link building, monthly reporting). But if you need that, I can recommend specialists who do it properly.

## 4. Can my website connect to Xero / MYOB?

Yes. That's one of the most valuable integrations I build.

When someone buys from your site, the order can flow directly into your accounting system — no re-typing, no manual invoices. For e-commerce especially, this saves hours every week.

## 5. Do you use WordPress, Shopify, or something else?

It depends on your needs:

• WordPress: Great for service businesses and content-heavy sites
• Shopify: Best for e-commerce with inventory and payments
• Custom builds: For high-performance or special requirements

I recommend what fits your business, not what pays me the most.
