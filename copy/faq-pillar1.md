## 1. What's the difference between your website tiers?

It comes down to speed and need. You pick based on your deadline.

• Starter (7 days): Captures leads. Simple. For tradies and local service businesses.
• E-commerce (14 days): Inventory. Payments. Shipping. The full store.
• Professional (21 days): Fast. Secure. Built for high-ticket services.
• Flagship (30+ days): Custom builds. 3D features. Animation.

I help you choose. I never upsell.

## 2. Will my website work properly on mobile?

Yes. I design for phones first.

Most visitors are on mobile. Often 70% or more. So we start there. Your site will load fast. It will look good. If someone fills out a form at 11pm on an iPhone, it works.

## 3. Do you handle SEO?

I build the foundation. Fast loading. Proper structure. Local tags.

I do not do ongoing campaigns. No monthly link building or blog writing. I build the race car. You drive it. If you need a driver, I can introduce you to a specialist.

## 4. Can my website connect to Xero / MYOB?

Yes. This integration saves massive amounts of time.

Someone buys from your site. The order flows straight into your accounting system. No re-typing. No manual invoices. It just happens.

## 5. Do you use WordPress, Shopify, or something else?

I use the right tool for the job.

• WordPress: Best for service businesses.
• Shopify: Best for selling products.
• Custom builds: Best for high performance.

I recommend what fits your business. Not what pays me a commission.
