## 1. What's the difference between your website tiers?

It comes down to speed and need. You pick based on your deadline.

• **Starter (7 days)**: Captures leads. Simple. For **tradies and local service businesses**.
• **E-commerce (14 days)**: Inventory. Payments. Shipping. The full **online store**.
• **Professional (21 days)**: Fast. Secure. Built for **high-ticket services**.
• **Flagship (30+ days)**: **Custom builds**. 3D features. Animation.

I help you choose. I never upsell.

## 2. Will my website work properly on mobile?

Yes. I design **mobile-first**.

Most visitors are on mobile. Often 70% or more. So we start there. Your site will **load fast**. It will look good. If someone fills out a form at 11pm on an iPhone, it works.

## 3. Do you handle SEO?

I build the **SEO foundation**. Fast loading. Proper structure. **Local business tags**.

I do not do ongoing campaigns. No monthly link building or blog writing. I build the race car. You drive it. If you need a driver, I can introduce you to an **SEO specialist**.

## 4. Can my website connect to Xero / MYOB?

Yes. This **accounting integration** saves massive amounts of time.

Someone buys from your site. The order flows straight into your **Xero or MYOB**. No re-typing. No manual invoices. It just happens.

## 5. Do you use WordPress, Shopify, or something else?

I use the right tool for the job.

• **WordPress**: Best for service businesses.
• **Shopify**: Best for selling products.
• **Custom React/Next.js**: Best for high performance.

I recommend what fits your business. Not what pays me a commission.
