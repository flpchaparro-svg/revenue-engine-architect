2. **Cognitive Layer Implementation** — Client: `National Law Firm` — Impact: `-15 hrs/wk Admin` — Desc: `Replacing manual data triage with a secure AI-Agentic bridge.

## Modal (Case Study: Group 7 Security)
- Title: `Case Study: Group 7 Security`
- Sub: `[ WEBSITE + SEO OVERHAUL ]`
- Compare: `BEFORE: Old .com Site` | `AFTER: New .com.au Site`
- Build log header: `Build Log // What I Did`
- Terminal lines: `> Added Sydney location tags for Google... [DONE]` | `> Removed slow code... [SAVED 2.1MB]` | `> Load time: 4.2s → 0.4s [10x FASTER]`
- **The Problem:** `They had a slow .com website with no local SEO. Google thought they were a global tech company, not a Sydney security firm. Local customers couldn't find them.`
- **What I Did:** `I migrated them to .com.au and rebuilt the site from scratch — fast, mobile-first, with proper Sydney location tags so Google knows exactly where they operate.`
- **The Result:** `Page load dropped from 4.2s to 0.4s. Local search rankings improved. The site now converts visitors instead of losing them.`
