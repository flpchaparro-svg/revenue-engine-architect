## 1. Do I need all 7 pillars?

No. Most start with one or two.

Each pillar works alone. You pick what you need. Add more later. Think of it like a renovation. You don't redo the whole house at once. Start with the pain.

---

## 2. Which pillar should I start with?

Start where you lose money.

- Losing leads? Fix the Website or CRM.
- Drowning in admin? Automation.
- Missing calls? AI Assistants.
- No time for marketing? Content.
- Team confused? Training.
- Flying blind? Dashboards.

If you aren't sure, book a call. We will figure it out.

---

## 3. Can I combine services into one project?

Yes. It is often smarter.

Building a website and CRM together makes sense. They connect from day one. No awkward integration later. I will tell you if combining helps or hurts.

---

## 4. How long does a project take?

I work in sprints.

- Quick wins: 3 to 7 days.
- Core builds: 7 to 14 days.
- Complex projects: 21 to 30+ days.

I don't do 6-month projects. You see results in weeks. Not quarters.

---

## 5. How much does this cost?

I don't list prices because every project varies.

But I work in fixed-price sprints. You know the cost before we start. It doesn't change. Book a call. Tell me what you need. I'll give you a number.

---

## 6. Do I own the systems you build?

You own everything.

I hand over access. I hand over training. I hand over docs. I don't lock you in. You will be fully equipped to run it yourself.

---

## 7. I've been burned by tech projects before. How is this different?

Most projects fail because of scope creep. Or the vendor disappears.

I work differently.
- Fixed sprints. Price is locked.
- Adoption is built-in. I stay until you use it.
- No lock-in. You own it.

---

## 8. Can we start with a small test project?

Absolutely. I recommend it.

Start small. A lead form. A simple bot. See how I work. Verify the results. If it works, we do more. If not, you risked very little.

---

## 9. How do the 3 systems work together?

It is a flow.

- GET CLIENTS: Brings people in.
- SCALE FASTER: Multiplies output.
- SEE CLEARLY: Shows what works.

You don't need all three to start. But when they connect, work gets done automatically.

---

## 10. What if I already have a CRM or website?

I work with what you have.

If your CRM is good, we keep it. I just add automation. If your website works, I just fix the tracking. I fix what is broken. I don't replace what works.

---

## 11. How involved do I need to be?

At the start, I need you. I need to learn your business.

After that, it is up to you. Weekly check-ins? Fine. Just want it done? Also fine.

---

## 12. What happens after the project is done?

Three options.

1. You run it yourself.
2. Monthly support.
3. Ad-hoc support.

Most clients start with option 1. Many move to option 2 when they see the value.
