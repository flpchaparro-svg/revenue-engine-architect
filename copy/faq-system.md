# FAQ — System Page

## 1. Do I need all 7 pillars?

No. Most businesses **start with one or two**.

Each pillar works on its own. You pick what you need now and add more later if it makes sense. Think of it like renovating a house. You don't redo everything at once. Start where the pain is worst.

---

## 2. Which pillar should I start with?

Depends on where you're losing time or money:

- Losing leads? Pillar 01 (**Website**) or Pillar 02 (**CRM**)
- Drowning in admin? Pillar 03 (**Business Automation**)
- Missing calls after hours? Pillar 04 (**AI Assistants**)
- No time for marketing? Pillar 05 (**Content Systems**)
- Team not using your tools? Pillar 06 (**Staff Training**)
- Flying blind on numbers? Pillar 07 (**Dashboards**)

Not sure? Book a call and I'll help you figure it out.

## 3. Can I combine services into one project?

Yes, and it's often smarter to do so.

If you need a **custom website** and a **HubSpot CRM**, building them together means they're **connected from day one**. No awkward integration later. I'll tell you honestly if combining makes sense or if you should do one first.

---

## 4. How long does a project take?

Most projects are delivered in **agile sprints**:

- **Quick wins**: 3 to 7 days (lead forms, basic automations)
- **Core builds**: 7 to 14 days (websites, CRM setup, AI bots)
- **Complex projects**: 21 to 30+ days (multi-system integration)

I don't do 6-month projects that drain your budget before you see results. You'll see progress in weeks, not quarters.

---

## 5. How much does this cost?

Every project is different, so I don't list prices.

What I can tell you: I work in **fixed-price sprints**. You know the cost before we start, and it doesn't change mid-project. Book a call, tell me what you need, and I'll give you a straight answer.

---

## 6. Do I own the systems you build?

**You own everything**. I hand over:

- **Full access** to all systems (no vendor lock-in)
- **Training videos** so your team knows how to use it
- **Documentation** for future reference

I'm not trying to lock you in. If you want ongoing support, we can arrange that. If you want to run it yourself, you'll be fully equipped.

---

## 7. I've been burned by tech projects before. How is this different?

I get it. Most tech projects fail because the scope creeps, the team doesn't use the new system, or you get locked into a vendor who disappears.

Here's how I work differently:

- **Fixed sprints**: Scope and price are locked
- **Adoption built-in**: I don't leave until your team actually uses it
- **No lock-in**: You own the code and the accounts

---

## 8. Can we start with a small test project?

Absolutely. I recommend it.

Start with something contained: a **lead capture form**, a simple **automation workflow**, or a quick **sales dashboard**. See how I work and whether the results are real. If it works, we do more. If it doesn't, you've risked very little.

---

## 9. How do the 3 systems work together?

Think of it as a **revenue flow**:

- **GET CLIENTS** (Pillars 1 to 3): Brings people in and captures their details
- **SCALE FASTER** (Pillars 4 to 6): Multiplies your output without multiplying your hours
- **SEE CLEARLY** (Pillar 7): Shows you what's working and what's not

You don't need all three to start. But when they're connected, leads flow in, work gets done automatically, and you see the results in real time.

---

## 10. What if I already have a CRM or website?

I work with what you have.

If your current **CRM setup** is fine but you need **automation** on top of it, I build that. If your website is decent but not capturing leads properly, I fix the forms and tracking. I'm not trying to replace everything. I fix what's broken.

---

## 11. How involved do I need to be?

For the **initial setup**: a few focused sessions where I learn your business, your workflow, and your pain points.

After that: as involved as you want to be. Some clients want weekly check-ins. Others just want me to build it and hand it over. Both work.

---

## 12. What happens after the project is done?

Three options:

1. **You run it yourself** (I give you training and docs)
2. **Monthly support retainer** (I monitor, maintain, and improve)
3. Call me when something breaks (**ad-hoc support**)

Most clients start with option 1 and move to option 2 once they see the value of **ongoing optimisation**.
