## Tiers & personas (full copy)

### PULSE — "I need to stop guessing."
- Summary: `You're flying blind. You have data in Xero, Google Ads, and your CRM but no single screen that tells you if you're winning or losing today.`
- Sprint: `7 DAYS`
- Specs: Google Tag Manager | Looker Studio | Attribution modelling | Basic KPIs

- **The Blind Scaler** (High-Volume Businesses) — Pain: Operational Blindness — `High volume, thin margins. You don't know your real profit until the accountant finishes the books at end of quarter. By then, the damage is done.` — Fix: `Real-time margin tracking. Inventory links to finance so you see the net profit on every single order the moment it happens. No more quarter-end surprises.`
- **The Margin Squeeze** (Distributors, Wholesalers) — Pain: Hidden Costs — `Revenue is up. Profit isn't. Something is eating your margin but you don't know what.` — Fix: `Margin breakdown by product, service, and customer. You see where money disappears.`
- **The Data Hoarder** (Founders with Multiple Systems) — Pain: Too Many Numbers — `You have 12 reports across 5 systems. Information overload. No clarity.` — Fix: `One dashboard. The 6 numbers that actually matter. Everything else is noise.`

### LAB — "I see what your customers see."
- Summary: `You need to understand customer behaviour. What are they clicking? Where do they drop off? What converts?`
- Sprint: `14 DAYS`
- Specs: Heat mapping | Funnel analysis | A/B testing | Conversion tracking

- **The Conversion Hunter** (E-commerce, Lead Gen Sites) — Pain: Website Leaks — `People visit your site. Most leave without enquiring. You don't know why.` — Fix: `Heat maps show where they click. Funnel analysis shows where they drop off. You fix the leaks.`
- **The Ad Spender** (Marketing Teams, Advertisers) — Pain: Wasted Budget — `You spend $5k/month on ads. Something works. You don't know what.` — Fix: `Attribution tracking. You see which ad, which keyword, which audience actually generates revenue.`
- **The Price Tester** (E-commerce, Service Biz) — Pain: Pricing Guesswork — `You think you could charge more. But you're scared to test it.` — Fix: `A/B testing. Show different prices to different visitors. Data tells you the answer.`

### ORACLE — "I need to predict the future."
- Summary: `Looking backwards isn't enough. You need to see what's coming. Forecasting, projections, early warnings.`
- Sprint: `21 DAYS`
- Specs: Revenue forecasting | Pipeline predictions | Trend analysis | Alert systems

- **The Cash Flow Guesser** (CFOs, Finance Directors) — Pain: Runway Anxiety — `"Will we make payroll next month?" You're never quite sure.` — Fix: `Cash flow projection based on pipeline, payment terms, and seasonal trends. You see problems before they hit.`
- **The Pipeline Dreamer** (Sales Leaders, RevOps) — Pain: Wishful Forecasting — `Your sales forecast is fiction. Deals that were "closing this week" last month are still "closing this week."` — Fix: `Reality-based forecasting. Weighted by probability, adjusted by historical conversion. Numbers you can trust.`
- **The Trend Spotter** (Strategy, Leadership) — Pain: Late Reactions — `You notice problems after they've hurt you. Slow sales, rising costs, churn. Always reactive.` — Fix: `Early warning indicators. Spot downturns before they become disasters. Act while you can still fix it.`

- **The Team Manager** (Sales Directors, Ops) — Pain: Performance Guessing — `Who's your best performer? Who's struggling? You go by gut, not data.` — Fix: `Team scorecards. Activity, outcomes, trends. You manage with facts, not feelings.`
- **The Acquisition Target** (Founders, Exit Planning) — Pain: Due Diligence Readiness — `You want to sell in 3 years. But you can't prove your numbers clearly.` — Fix: `Investor-ready dashboards. Clean data. Clear trends. You look professional when it matters.`
